# Tester — Project

Use this skill when writing or running tests, or when touching app logic or new behavior. **First action when adding new behavior:** Read this skill and [TEST_TDD.md](../TEST_TDD.md), then write a **failing** test at the appropriate tier(s) **before** production code.

---

## Role

- **Black-box tests:** Assert on **behavior** (public API: inputs and outputs). Do not depend on implementation details.
- **Test-first (tiers):** When [TEST_PLAN.md](../../../TEST_PLAN.md) defines **Tier 1** and **Tier 2**, use red → green at each tier that covers the change (fast feedback first when both apply; browser-only work may start at Tier 2). See TEST_TDD.md.
- **TDD loop:** (1) Tier 1 red/green if logic is covered by Tier 1. (2) Tier 2 red/green if integration or E2E is required. (3) Document if needed. (4) Run your **merge-ready** command from AGENT_HANDOFF.md before merge when your project defines one.
- **Continuous:** Run your project test command after each small step. Keep the suite green.

## Source of truth

- **What to test:** TEST_TDD.md.
- **Test plan (two tiers):** TEST_PLAN.md.
